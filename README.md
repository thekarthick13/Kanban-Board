## React project using Vite. Data is fetched from a custom API.


This project is an assignment that was given to me to be considered for Front-end developer for QuickSell.

Note: This project was created with reference to my Windows Hp Laptop. So there might be minor alterations when viewed on a device with different resolution.
Here's the approach I've used for this project.
The requirements for this project was to have 3 kinds of display: 'Status-wise', 'User-wise', 'Priority-wise'.

I made three different jsx components namely : StatusCards, UserCards, PriorityCards. And I've written a code in App.jsx to display only those card component jsx file whose respective option has been selected in a drop down options button.
Eg: if u choose Display Priority wise, only PriorityCards.jsx will get rendered and so on.

In each Card.jsx file, I've made 5 divs. And I've written code to display each div to display cards(tickets) which can be dynamically filtered using the Ordering options. All these divs are displayed on the page using the order which was specified in the Assignment description.
